TODO Cralwy post 1.0 version


Better Interface:{

AsyncLoader:
	SubmitCheck(URL url) method /Done

Cralwer: 
	isSuspended() method /Done

	isTerminated() method /Done

	resubmit(URI uri) method /Done

	getProgression() method	/Later
	Unify CralwerResult and CralwerResultBean /Later (after kryo dependancy)

siteCralwer:
    idem
    getDomain() method /Done

cralwer e sitecralwer 
	Use Observable Collections
}

Implements initialized but unstarted visit (Need some refactor of GestoreDownload init)

Kryo Depend for better serialization

Generic interface for GUI chain

Better generality for wsa.web objects /Done Crated Factory interface for all interface in wsa.web and Parsed interface

Internationalizations (eng translation)

Implement the possibility for designed cralwer implementation to choose if bypass some non-html pages

Better Options

Use different Web framework

Trasfrom part to the code in Scalalang (expecially singletons)  OR Use project Lombok library  /LAter separate branch

Plugin Interface with ClassLoader

thread delegation for SiteCrawler creartions

Others

Security constraints. (Expecially prevent dispose to being called outside the MainFrame or CloseFrame)

Exception delegation

Fix Maximum distance bug

Chache

Recover visit: make the first downlaoded page as the first position
